# 🌱 Comparative Analysis of Biomass Energy Yield

This repository contains a comprehensive academic project on evaluating **biomass energy yield** through two parallel approaches: **stoichiometric combustion estimation** and **real-world biomass plant performance data**.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project compares the theoretical energy output of biomass fuels based on chemical analysis with actual energy outputs observed in commercial biomass power plants. The work aims to quantify the efficiency gap and explore optimization strategies for biomass-based energy systems.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Estimate theoretical energy yield via stoichiometric combustion.
- Analyze real-world data from biomass plants using wood chips, rice husk, and bagasse.
- Identify losses due to moisture, incomplete combustion, and heat transfer inefficiencies.
- Calculate and compare **Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)** across feedstocks.
- Recommend design, preprocessing, and control strategies to reduce the efficiency gap.

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Biomass Type | HHV (MJ/kg) | Real-World Efficiency (%) | LCOE (USD/kWh) |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| Wood Chips   | ~19.0       | 28                         | 0.125          |
| Rice Husk    | ~15.5       | 22                         | 0.100          |
| Bagasse      | ~17.5       | 25                         | 0.098          |

- **Bagasse** emerged as the most cost-effective biomass option.
- Over **70% of theoretical energy** is lost in real systems.
